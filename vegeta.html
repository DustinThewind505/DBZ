                        fighter, Vegeta continues his vigorous training at Bulma's house, coming much closer to Gohan's
                        Super
                        Saiyan 2 power due to Gohan focusing on his studies.

                        Trunks
                        stronger than both Gohan and Goku's second son, Goten, as he strongly believes Gohan's Super

                        was Goku's doing.
