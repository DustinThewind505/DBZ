                    Vegeta and Bulma initially met on planet Namek, but neither actually talked to the other; Bulma was
                    too frightened, and Vegeta did not care, especially when his main concern was to find the Dragon
                    Balls. However, their first interaction with each other was prior to his rematch with Zarbon, to
                    which Vegeta threatened to kill both Bulma and Krillin. The first time any affection is displayed
                    between them is in "Immortality Denied", in which Vegeta, during a conversation with Gohan, refers
                    to Bulma as a "Gorgeous Girl" in the Ocean Group dubs.
