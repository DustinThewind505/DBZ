            <p>Seven years after the Cell Games, despite lacking a worthy opponent, and having abandoned his role as a
                fighter, Vegeta continues his vigorous training at Bulma's house, coming much closer to Gohan's Super
                Saiyan 2 power due to Gohan focusing on his studies.
                Now that Goku is gone, Vegeta's goal is no longer to become stronger than him, but to make Trunks
                stronger than both Gohan and Goku's second son, Goten, as he strongly believes Gohan's Super Saiyan 2
                was Goku's doing.
                He is first seen emerging from a gravity room after training with Trunks, when Gohan comes to have fun
                with Trunks.
                While Gohan greets Vegeta kindly, Vegeta gives Gohan a cold look and tells him that he should've
                continued training, in his opinion, "living in times of peace is no excuse to be lazy".
